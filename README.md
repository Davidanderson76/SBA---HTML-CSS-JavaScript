## Description

- In this Skill-based Assessment, you will be creating a small website and you get to pick what is the website about. The main purpose of this SBA is to test my skills in implementing a clean HTML structure that follows the methodologies of visual design, and styling your site so that it is user-friendly.

- I made multiple pages to fulfill all of the technical requirements, all while keeping it mobile friendly and in the same theme, making sure each page was user friendly and would guide the user through each section comfortably.
